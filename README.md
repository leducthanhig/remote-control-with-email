1. To run the executable files directly, copy the one in `x64/Release` folder to `env/bin` folder.

2. To build, only use configuration **release x64** in Visual Studio due to some non-debug libraries.

3. Give me the email address which you want to use to received mails before using the `Client` application.

4. Set environment variables for developing: **PATH=$(SolutionDir)env\bin
QT_PLUGIN_PATH=$(SolutionDir)env\plugins**

5. For more information, contact me via **23120165@student.hcmus.edu.vn**.
