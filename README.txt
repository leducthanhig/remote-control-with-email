1. If you want to run the executable file directly, copy the one in 'x64/Release' folder to '{projectName}/bin' folder.

2. Give me the email address which you will use to send mails before using the 'Client' application.

3. Run Visual Studio as administrator for making 'Server' application work correctly.

4. If you want to build from source, just use *release* mode due to some non-debug OpenCV's libraries.
